# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
Everything meaningful sits in `src/`: UI components in `src/components/`, localized pages in `src/pages/` (Polish at the root, English under `src/pages/en/`), JSON copy in `src/data/`, shared contracts in `src/types.ts`, utilities in `src/utils/`, and Tailwind tweaks in `src/styles/global.css`. Keep static assets and meta files in `public/`. The `dist/` directory is generated by the build and must stay untouched.

## Build, Test & Development Commands
`npm install` hydrates dependencies. Use `npm run dev` for hot-reload development on `localhost:4321`, `npm run build` for the optimized bundle, and `npm run preview` to smoke-test that output. `npm run check` invokes Astro Check for TypeScript, Markdown, and accessibility diagnostics. Reach for `npm run astro <subcommand>` when scaffolding integrations or running CLI utilities.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Stick to two-space indentation. Components stay in PascalCase (`TrainerProfiles.astro`), route files use kebab-case to mirror URL slugs (`o-nas.astro`), and data-driven text belongs in `src/data` rather than inline markup. Prefer Tailwind utilities; only add custom CSS in `global.css` with narrowly scoped selectors. Extend the types in `src/types.ts` before evolving JSON payloads, and keep imports path-relative inside `src/` to work with Vite aliases.

## Testing Guidelines
There is no standalone unit-test runner yet, so treat `npm run check` plus `npm run build && npm run preview` as the baseline gate before every push. Manually click through the home hero, schedule widget, and trainer grid in both locales to ensure data alignment. When experimenting with new JSON structures, log assertions in Astro frontmatter temporarily and document any missing automated coverage in your PR.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Commits follow the imperative, title-cased style seen in `git log` (“Add reusable SocialMeta component…”). Keep each commit focused, referencing affected components or data files when relevant. PRs need a problem statement, implementation summary, manual test notes, and—when UI shifts—before/after screenshots. Link issues, request review from content owners when JSON changes, and confirm both `pl` and `en` routes were exercised locally.

## Localization & Content Tips
Astro’s `i18n` defaults to Polish without a prefix, so only English routes require `/en/...` paths. Update `src/data/classes.*.json` and `src/data/info.*.json` in tandem, keeping IDs stable because components rely on them as keys. If locale-specific layout diverges, create a dedicated template under `src/pages/en/` rather than branching heavily inside a single file.
